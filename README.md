# Java-Games
This repository features a collection of fun and interactive Java games built using JFrames and JPanels. These projects were developed as part of my practice with object-oriented programming.

🕹️ What’s Inside:

    - Simple 2D games with keyboard/mouse interactions
    - Game loops, timers, and score tracking
    - Logic-based gameplay (e.g., matching, guessing, puzzles)
